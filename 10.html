And YHVH Elohim spoke all these words, saying,

I am YHVH your Elohim,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
out of the house of slavery.

You shall have no other gods beside YHVH.

You shall not make for yourself a carved image,
or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above,
or that is in the earth beneath,
or that is in the water under the earth.

You shall not bow down to them or serve them,
for I YHVH your Elohim am a jealous Elohim,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate YHVH,

but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love YHVH and keep YHVH's commandments.

You shall not take the name of YHVH your Elohim in vain,
for YHVH will not hold him guiltless who takes YHVH's name in vain.

Remember the Sabbath day,
to keep it holy.

Six days you shall labor,
and do all your work,

but the seventh day is a Sabbath to YHVH your Elohim.
On it you shall not do any work,
you,
nor your son,
nor your daughter,
your male servant,
nor your female servant,
nor your livestock,
nor the sojourner who is within your gates.

For in six days YHVH made heaven and earth,
the sea,
and all that is in them,
and rested on the seventh day.

Therefore YHVH blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

Honor your father and your mother,
that your days may be long in the land
that YHVH your Elohim is giving you.

You shall not murder.

You shall not commit adultery.

You shall not steal.

You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

You shall not covet your neighbor's house;
you shall not covet your neighbor's wife,
nor his male servant,
nor his female servant,
nor his ox,
nor his donkey,
nor anything that is your neighbor's.
