#Pivotal Tracker
Tracker is less about creating goals and more about tracking what you're actual doing, how far along, and what's left to do.

## Process

### Gathering Requirements 
A project begins with collaboration between the Product Owner and a developer team. This is the high level meeting to capture requirements in broad strokes through a highly caffeinated process of index cards and sharpie markers to support the creative juices. The majority of the backlog will be developed here, but stories can be added along the entire process. 

### Story Breakdown
Developers then review the index cards and convert them into stories. Stories are the more tangible version of the feature. This flushes out the idea into work tasks and enable stores to be estimated and prioritized.

**An example**

Index Card may say: "Shopping cart" (user, item, session and cart)

That index card will be converted into multiple stories including: 
"As a user, I should be able to add an item to a cart"

### Story Estimation
Once stores are written, developers will estimate the complexity of story. This is done instead of time since it's easier for a developer to visual a task, rather than due date.

**Point system**

1 points - Relatively straight forward story.

2 points - Challenging story.

4 points - A story requiring research.

8 points - This story needs to broken down to smaller stories. .

**Iteration & velocity**
Points are used to track progress and improve clarity of delivery. An iteration is considered a week.
Velocity is determined by averaging of last 3 iterations. Velocity automatically calculates important dates.

### Prioritization
Once the stories have been written and estimated, the Product Owner will prioritize. 
Based on priority is what developers will set to work on.

### Build Software
Code will be in 3 environments, and four steps;

**Environments**

Developer Environment - Code is written

Staging Environment - Code is tested

Production Environment - Code pushed to client.

**Steps**

- Start - Get to work!

- Finished - Code ready for testing.

- Delivered - Upon passing tests, code is sent to client.

- Acceptance - Client approves code for production environment.

### Acceptance
The Product Owner will use the story and either accept, or reject it. If the story is accepted, then it's done. If not, it will restart based on PO's comments.

### Stories will travel through 4 panels
1. Icebox - Write & Estimate stories
2. Backlog - Prioritize & Estimate stories
3. Current - Build Software
4. Done - Accepted Stories
