# ABOUT: Project Euler Problem 1

# STATUS: My test is passing. Why? Seems like it should be failing sinc there is no output in the method.

# SETUP:
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

# PROBLEM:
# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# TEST:
=begin
doctest: Show all numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5
>> sum_of_multiples(10) 
==> 3, 5, 6, 9
=end

def sum_of_multiples(number)
