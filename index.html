        Call me paranoid, but you can't rely on a single technology as a savior. That's what this site is. Rather, this is the first edition. I am motivated to keep it alive. It doesn't have all the fancy tools that <a href="http://and.or.at">and-img('/Photos/0/logo-and.jpg') | &amp;</a> has. But that's okay. It's been a long journey since I last worked on this project. 6 years to be exact. I'm excited to dig through the archives. Imagine writing some kind of front-end framework for blogging this way in ruby. What would the angle be? Imagine that all this template just has to be `<.volt>`. If you use a volt file, it runs ruby into JS. Then, you can code with ruby and make cool pages. It would be like doing PHP, but with ... R... U-B-Y.

        Okay. now that we have that covered. Here are the things that it needs to be out of the box:

        - markdown
        - configurable
        - pure html
        - partials
        - js magic libraries stuff for UI components to do things that bloggers like to do. What &AND does on Nanoc. It can be run on the nanoc engine. And guess what, it's Ruby! It would be like me building a Rails, but less, and on top of more infrastructure. But what does it buy?
