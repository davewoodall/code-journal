## About

The knowledge I have is limited and cluttered with a lot of garbage, confusion, and bad ideas.I tried to blog and evernote everything I thought relevant. But the stage that I'm at is more of an on the fly learning. I don't have time (or insight) yet to slow down and compose a helpful blog post yet.

This code journal will organize all of the topics/notes/questions into a linear process to see what I am learning. It's not necessarily for technical reasons but more to create a paper trail to confirm that progress is happening :-) 

## Current Questions
_9/1_

1. Why is my testing environment not loading for code-journal Dir? 
_I'm sure it's something with my RVM configuration._

2. Why is my test on project euler ex passing?

## Tasks

2. Figure out how to ignore '.' files in github (.DStore, .rvmrc)
