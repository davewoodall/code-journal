### Eat. Sleep. Code.

The knowledge I have is limited and cluttered with a lot of garbage, confusion, and bad ideas. 

I tried to blog and evernote everything I thought relevant. But the stage that I'm at is more of an on the fly learning. I don't have time (or insight) yet to slow down and compose a helpful blog post yet.

This code journal will organize all of the topics/notes/questions into a linear process to see what I am learning. 

It's not necessarily for technical reasons but more to create a paper trail to confirm that progress is happening :-)
