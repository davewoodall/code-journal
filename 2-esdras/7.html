          When I had finished speaking these words, the angel who had been sent

          I said, <br>"Speak, YHVH my Lord."
          <br>
          And YHVH said to me, <br>

          If there are those who wish to reach the sea, to look at it or to
          navigate it, how can they come to the broad part unless they pass
          through the narrow part?

          And so the entrances of this world were made narrow and sorrowful and
          toilsome; they are few and evil, full of dangers and involved in great
          hardships.

          the person who has what is plentiful.

          So also will be the judgment that YHVH have promised; <br>for YHVH will
          rejoice over the few who shall be saved, because it is they who have
          made YHVH glory to prevail now, and through them YHVH's name has now
          been honored.

          is they who are now like a mist, and are similar to a flame and smoke
          - they are set on fire and burn hotly, and are extinguished."
