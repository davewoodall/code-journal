# Now

I've begun a new phase of life. I want to bring back structure and discipline. This page is my attempt to formalize my new vision, missions, goals, initiatives, and reasons for them.

# Vision

[]()
I want to 
## live according to the flow of the first four commandments. 

## ship deliverables

## begin with first things first; and that being my internal self organized

## view a computer as a tool and not a toy upon which my deliverables are: produced, managed, and distributed.

All of which take time and I have the time to do this. I have the time to be productive and successful. I have the time to be creative and communicate clearly. I have the time to think things through. Regardless of what I want, I have limited relationships. I have enough to be full. I have wide enough interests that I can apply my time to a variety of things and not be bored or stuck in a rut. 

Plus, I am living this way as unto YHVH. YHVH is my Master, King, Shield, Shepherd. YHVH knows who I am and what He wants of me. I want to be ready for whatever and whenever YHVH summons me.

### Definitions

#### Produced

My content is text, visual, and audio. Some of my thinking is done using a computer, but the deliverables are ultimately created and distributed here.
