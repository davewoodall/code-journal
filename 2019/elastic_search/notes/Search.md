# Search 

Search is a series of inputs over a data set that is largely unknown

The major pieces include 
- what the conditions are that can identify the specific results of interest. This is know as the query.

- the perception is that a set of results will return. We have control over the presentation of those results. That is, how should the list of results be sorted

- another dimension we dictate is how many results, and where in the larger scope of options are we interested in seeing.


- sometimes we are simply interested in overviews, like the count, of sum of a particular item. Those are referred to as aggregations.
