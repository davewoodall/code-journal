# Search

Search is a series of inputs over a data set that is largely unknown.

## Relevance

The goal of a search is to provide relevant results. There are two different definitions of how relevance can be defined:

- the search results answered your question or solved your problem
- the user understands easily why the search engine retrieved these results.

Term Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency



## The components of making a search

- what the conditions are that can identify the specific results of interest. This is know as the query.

- the perception is that a set of results will return. We have control over the presentation of those results. That is, how should the list of results be sorted

- another dimension we dictate is how many results, and where in the larger scope of options are we interested in seeing.

- sometimes we are simply interested in overviews, like the count, of sum of a particular item. Those are referred to as aggregations.
