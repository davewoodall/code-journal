However the description of it found in Gen. 6 through 8 makes this patently absurd. If it was local, Noah had 120 years to migrate out of the area to safe ground! Why waste all that effort building a ship? He only had to move less than 1500 feet a day to reach the farthest point on the globe! With the possible exception of Ps 29:10, this word always refers to Noah's flood. The real reason for insisting on a local flood is the acceptance of evolution with its long geological ages. Most holding that view are not willing to allow a global world wide flood to have happened less than 5000 years ago. To admit such eliminates the need for the geological ages for most of the geological column would have been rapidly laid down by Noah's flood."}}],"versions":[{"version":"New International Version","text":"And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood."},{"version":"New Living Translation","text":"He went on board the boat to escape the flood—he and his wife and his sons and their wives."},{"version":"English Standard Version","text":"And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood."},{"version":"Berean Study Bible","text":"And Noah and his wife, with his sons and their wives, entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood."},{"version":"New American Standard Bible ","text":"Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood."},{"version":"New King James Version","text":"So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood."},{"version":"King James Bible","text":"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."},{"version":"Christian Standard Bible","text":"So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives entered the ark because of the floodwaters."},{"version":"Good News Translation","text":"He and his wife, and his sons and their wives, went into the boat to escape the flood.
