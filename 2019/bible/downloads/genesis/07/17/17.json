However the description of it found in Gen. 6 through 8 makes this patently absurd. If it was local, Noah had 120 years to migrate out of the area to safe ground! Why waste all that effort building a ship? He only had to move less than 1500 feet a day to reach the farthest point on the globe! With the possible exception of Ps 29:10, this word always refers to Noah's flood. The real reason for insisting on a local flood is the acceptance of evolution with its long geological ages. Most holding that view are not willing to allow a global world wide flood to have happened less than 5000 years ago. To admit such eliminates the need for the geological ages for most of the geological column would have been rapidly laid down by Noah's flood."}},{"source":{"book":"genesis","chapter":7,"verse":17,"reference":"genesis 7:17","text":"forty"},"hebrew":{"word":"םיִ֥עָּבְרַא","translit":"’ar-bā-‘îm","defined":"'ar·ba·'Im: forty
