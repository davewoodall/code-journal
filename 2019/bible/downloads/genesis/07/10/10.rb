Why waste all that effort building a ship? He only had to move less than 1500 feet a day to reach the farthest point on the globe! With the possible exception of Ps 29:10, this word always refers to Noah's flood. The real reason for insisting on a local flood is the acceptance of evolution with its long geological ages. Most holding that view are not willing to allow a global world wide flood to have happened less than 5000 years ago. To admit such eliminates the need for the geological ages for most of the geological column would have been rapidly laid down by Noah's flood."}}, {:source=>{:book=>"genesis", :chapter=>7, :verse=>10, :reference=>"genesis 7:10", :text=>"were"}, :hebrew=>{:word=>"ּו֖יָה", :translit=>"hā-yū", :defined=>"ha·Yu: came ", :stats=>[{:occurance=>"2", :total=>"167"}]}, :strongs=>{:strong_number=>"1961", :strong_definition=>"Strong's Hebrew 1961: 1) to be, become, come to pass, exist, happen, fall out <BR> 1a) (Qal) <BR> 1a1) ----- <BR> 1a1a) to happen, fall out, occur, take place, come about, come to pass <BR> 1a1b) to come about, come to pass <BR> 1a2) to come into being, become <BR> 1a2a) to arise, appear, come <BR> 1a2b) to become <BR> 1a2b1) to become <BR> 1a2b2) to become like <BR> 1a2b3) to be instituted, be established <BR> 1a3) to be <BR> 1a3a) to exist, be in existence <BR> 1a3b) to abide, remain, continue (with word of place or time) <BR> 1a3c) to stand, lie, be in, be at, be situated (with word of locality) <BR> 1a3d) to accompany, be with <BR> 1b) (Niphal) <BR> 1b1) to occur, come to pass, be done, be brought about <BR> 1b2) to be done, be finished, be gone"}}, {:source=>{:book=>"genesis", :chapter=>7, :verse=>10, :reference=>"genesis 7:10", :text=>"upon"}, :hebrew=>{:word=>"־לַע", :translit=>"‘al-", :defined=>"'al-: upon ", :stats=>[{:occurance=>"24", :total=>"3469"}]}, :strongs=>{:strong_number=>"5921", :strong_definition=>"Strong's Hebrew 5921: prep<BR> 1) upon, on the ground of, according to, on account of, on behalf of, concerning, beside, in addition to, together with, beyond, above, over, by, on to, towards, to, against <BR> 1a) upon, on the ground of, on the basis of, on account of, because of, therefore, on behalf of, for the sake of, for, with, in spite of, notwithstanding, concerning, in the matter of, as regards <BR> 1b) above, beyond, over (of excess) <BR> 1c) above, over (of elevation or pre-eminence) <BR> 1d) upon, to, over to, unto, in addition to, together with, with (of addition) <BR> 1e) over (of suspension or extension) <BR> 1f) by, adjoining, next, at, over, around (of contiguity or proximity) <BR> 1g) down upon, upon, on, from, up upon, up to, towards, over towards, to, against (with verbs of motion) <BR> 1h) to (as a dative) <BR> conj <BR> 2) because that, because, notwithstanding, although"}}, {:source=>{:book=>"genesis", :chapter=>7, :verse=>10, :reference=>"genesis 7:10", :text=>"the earth"}, :hebrew=>{:word=>"׃ץֶרָֽאָה", :translit=>"hā-’ā-reṣ.", :defined=>"ha·'A·retz.: the earth ", :stats=>[{:occurance=>"30", :total=>"934"}]}, :strongs=>{:strong_number=>"776", :strong_definition=>"Strong's Hebrew 776: 1) land, earth<BR> 1a) earth <BR> 1a1) whole earth (as opposed to a part) <BR> 1a2) earth (as opposed to heaven) <BR> 1a3) earth (inhabitants) <BR> 1b) land <BR> 1b1) country, territory <BR> 1b2) district, region <BR> 1b3) tribal territory <BR> 1b4) piece of ground <BR> 1b5) land of Canaan, Israel <BR> 1b6) inhabitants of land <BR> 1b7) Sheol, land without return, (under) world <BR> 1b8) city (-state) <BR> 1c) ground, surface of the earth <BR> 1c1) ground <BR> 1c2) soil <BR> 1d) (in phrases) <BR> 1d1) people of the land <BR> 1d2) space or distance of country (in measurements of distance) <BR> 1d3) level or plain country <BR> 1d4) land of the living <BR> 1d5) end(s) of the earth <BR> 1e) (almost wholly late in usage) <BR> 1e1) lands, countries <BR> 1e1a) often in contrast to Canaan"}}], :versions=>[{:version=>"New International Version", :text=>"And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth."}, {:version=>"New Living Translation", :text=>"After seven days, the waters of the flood came and covered the earth."}, {:version=>"English Standard Version", :text=>"And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth."}, {:version=>"Berean Study Bible", :text=>"And after seven days the floodwaters came upon the earth."}, {:version=>"New American Standard Bible ", :text=>"It came about after the seven days, that the water of the flood came upon the earth."}, {:version=>"New King James Version", :text=>"And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth."}, {:version=>"King James Bible", :text=>"And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."}, {:version=>"Christian Standard Bible", :text=>"Seven days later the floodwaters came on the earth."}, {:version=>"Contemporary English Version", :text=>"Seven days later a flood began to cover the earth.
