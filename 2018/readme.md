# Code Journal

As I study software, I do so through a medium such as a blog, book, course, video, or repo. The best way for me to start is to place it by it's asset type.

I would hope to be able to convert the lessons into their own webpage of knowledge upon grasping it myself. That is what I think the SortPop blog could be.

## Process;

- find a resource
- take notes
- convert to SortPop
